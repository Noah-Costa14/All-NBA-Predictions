# All-NBA-Predictions
Python project using logistic regression modeling of players in-season statistics to create predictions of the All-NBA team players.

Want to use as many descriptive numerical statistcs as possible found in different data sets to fit current players to All-NBA players in past years.

The code starts by cleaning the different data sets being used by making all the different data sets the same and uniform.
Then build a logistic regression model based on different statistics based on the position of the player.
Use the models output to create a list of players by position that we believe best fit to be an All-NBA player.
